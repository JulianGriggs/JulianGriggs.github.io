Distilling the essence of who you are into a short "about page" is surprisingly hard -- so consider this a work in progress.

My name is Julian Griggs and I am a professional software engineer living in San Francisco and working at [LightStep](https://lightstep.com/). I love solving business problems with software so this is pretty much the perfect field to be in. I moved to San Francisco in 2015 after graduating from Princeton University with a degree in Computer Science. At Princeton I was a member of the varsity soccer team, an affiliation that was core to my identity during school and remains so to this day. These days I have "hung up the boots" and instead get my athletic fix by running and weight lifting. Beyond writing software and exercising, I also regularly practice meditation and am learning how to play the guitar. 

As I build out this blog, I'm sure I'll touch on all of these topics more.
