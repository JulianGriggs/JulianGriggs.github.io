## TLDR
My name is Julian Griggs and I am a professional software engineer living in San Francisco. I like lifting weights, eating good food, practicing meditation, and learning new things. This blog is a place for me to collect (and hopefully _clarify_) my thoughts on various topics.

Distilling the essence of who you are into a short "about page" is surprisingly hard -- so consider this a work in progress.

## Professional
I currently am a senior software engineer at Headspace where I focus primarily on Headspace's enterprise offering. It's amazing to work at a company whose mission is to improve the health and happiness of the world. That's something I can get behind. 

Before Headspace I worked as a software engineer at [Lightstep](https://lightstep.com/) where our mission was to help engineers observe their applications with confidence, _at scale_. At Lightstep I had the opportunity to work with incredible people on some really interesting problems. I've worked all throughout our stack from our front-end React/Redux application to our data-processing back-end services, to our core infrastructure & networking layer. 

Before Lightstep, I worked at [Course Hero](https://www.coursehero.com/) in what was my first full-time software engineering job. While at Course Hero, I primarily worked on the Proprietary Content team, with a little over a year spent as that team's Tech Lead. Our team, working in close coordination with the Content Development team, created compelling study guides and infographics that helped students "master their classes".

## Interests
For the vast majority of my life, I identified as a soccer player first and foremost. But things change, and after an unfortunate series of concussions, I have officially "hung up the boots" and am enjoying retirement. These days I get my athletic fix from lifting weights and running. I love watching sports -- particularly soccer and basketball where my allegiances are summed up by:

GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED & WAAARRRIIOORRRSSS

I'm fascinated by meditation and try to maintain a daily practice. It significantly impacts my happiness and well being. For those new to medidation, I highly recommend [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/). If you like that, and want to deepen your theoretical understanding of mindfulness practice, I recommend the instruction Sam Harris provides in his [Waking Up app](https://wakingup.com/). The two supplement each other well.

Recently, I've been playing a fair amount of tennis and am currently working to emulate Federer's sublime backhand. Give me a few more months and I'll get there.

## Education
I graduated from Princeton University in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. During my senior year, I wrote a [thesis](/uploads/pdf/thesis.pdf) on the automatic summarization of text which was advised by [Dr. Ananda Gunawardena](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~guna/).
I was a member of the varsity soccer team, an affiliation that was core to my identity during school and remains so to this day and was a member of University Cottage Club. The people I met through these affiliations remain some of my closest friends today.
