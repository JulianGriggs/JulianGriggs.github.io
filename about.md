## TLDR

My name is Julian Griggs and I am a professional software engineer living in San Francisco. I like lifting weights, eating good food, practicing meditation, and learning new things. This blog is a place for me to collect (and hopefully _clarify_) my thoughts on various topics.

Distilling the essence of who you are into a short "about page" is surprisingly hard -- so consider this a work in progress.

## Professional
Since October of 2017 I've been working as a software engineer at [LightStep](https://lightstep.com/) where we are helping engineers observe their applications with confidence, _at scale_. At LightStep I've had the opportunity to work with incredible people on some really interesting problems. I've worked all throughout our stack from our front-end React/Redux application to our data-processing back-end services, to our core infrastructure & networking layer. 

Before LightStep, I worked at [Course Hero](https://www.coursehero.com/) in what was my first full-time software engineering job. While at Course Hero, I primarily worked on the Proprietary Content team, with a little over a year spent as that team's Tech Lead. Our team, working in close coordination with the Content Development team, created compelling study guides and infographics that helped students "master their classes".

## My Interests
For the vast majority of my life, I identified as a soccer player first and foremost. But things change, and after an unfortunate series of concussions, I have officially "hung up the boots" and am enjoying retirement. These days I get my athletic fix from lifting weights and running. I love watching sports -- particularly soccer and basketball where my allegiances are summed up by:

GLORY GLORY MAN UNITED & WAAARRRIIOORRRSSS

I'm fascinated by meditation and try to maintain a daily practice. It significantly impacts my happiness and well being. I really like the instruction Sam Harris provides in his [Waking Up app](https://wakingup.com/) and recommend it to anyone interested in the practice.

I'm also an aspiring guitarist and have been practicing at it for the past six months. I'm taking it slow but have been thrilled with the progress I've made in that period of time. A HUGE thank you to Justin Sandercoe at [Justin Guitar](https://www.justinguitar.com/) for creating amazing instructional content. Your songbooks are great too.

## Education
I graduated from Princeton University in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. During my senior year, I wrote a thesis on the automatic summarization of text which was advised by [Dr. Ananda Gunawardena](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~guna/).
I was a member of the varsity soccer team, an affiliation that was core to my identity during school and remains so to this day and was a member of University Cottage Club. The people I met through these affiliations remain some of my closest friends today.
