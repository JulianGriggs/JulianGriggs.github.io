title: Your Mind is a Garden

> Man’s mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or neglected, it must, and will, bring forth. If no useful seeds are put into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will fall therein, and will continue to produce their kind.

This quotation comes from James Allen’s, *As a Man Thinketh*. The central premise of this work is that we are literally the aggregate of what we think: character is the summation of thought, outer circumstances are the result of inner dialogue, and physical health is contingent upon the purity of the mind. Allen is convinced that our thoughts exert causal influence on all aspects of our reality. He declares this relationship to be as fundamental as any physical law of the universe. 

Our minds are factories that constantly process raw sounds, sights, and sensations transforming them into recognizable experiences. Without this machinery, our consciousness breaks down. The problem is that we are naive about what is required to keep this equipment operating optimally. Many of us have probably never considered it at all. Every piece of physical equipment requires deliberate maintenance to keep it operating effectively: guitars need restringing, camera lenses need polishing, and knives need sharpening. Why should the mind be any different? The power of Allen’s quotation comes from the way it frames the mind as something to be intentionally given attention to.

But how do we cultivate our minds? There is plenty of information available to those who wish to cultivate their bodies. With countless diet and exercise programs available you can begin sowing the seeds of your bodily well-being today. When it comes to improving the mind, though, there aren’t nearly as many resources available. This is troubling when we consider the second half of the quotation. Without intentionally sowing the seeds of a healthy mind, we are leaving the harvest up to chance — we might get lucky and have it bear fruit, but we are just as likely to reap pestilence. 

This is where having what William Irvine calls a “philosophy of life” is useful. You can use this philosophy in the same way you use a diet or exercise program, but for the mind. Every time your thoughts wonder from the dictate of your philosophy, you should course correct. A philosophy of life is something that is deeply personal and can vary person to person. In much the same way there is no single exercise regime that is ideal for all people, I doubt that there is a single philosophy of life that is the right choice for everyone. But that doesn’t reduce the value that having one provides.

As you think about how you would like to cultivate your mind, consider another quotation from *As a Man Thinketh*.

> Self-control is strength; Right Thought is mastery; Calmness is power. Say unto your heart, “Peace, be still!”
