In my [previous post]({% post_url 2019-09-17-is-this-good-enough %}
) I mentioned that I had temporarily reframed my approach to work as a quest of continuous learning. I began to approach each work day with the explicit goal of learning something new. While I was diligent about this I experienced a renewed vigor and greater satisfaction with my day-to-day work life. Like most resolutions, unfortunately, after a couple of weeks I slacked off and lost my commitment. 

I’ve been doing some thinking about ways I can live a better life and I keep coming back to the idea of living *deliberately*. I want to live according to my own goals, on my own terms. Work, being a major part of my life, is the first aspect I want to be more deliberate about. So with that as my motivation, I’m going to try again. I’m going to make *learning* my intention for work, and I will be deliberate about doing things each work day that are aimed at this objective.

In order to hold myself more accountable, I’m going to start a *Today I Learned* series on this blog. My goal is to record an entry for each work day that includes at least one thing that I learned on that day. Unfortunately, with the holiday season beginning there aren’t *that* many work days left in the year so maybe I’ll supplement with other things that I learned in my personal life. My secondary goal is to get back into the habit of writing regularly. Sharing a short *Today I Learned* post seems like a great way to do this. I hope you enjoy!

P.S. I did this exercise in the past (before I decided to put them on the blog) so I'll probably post some of those old learnings as well.
